You are an expert senior frontend engineer + product designer.

Build a production-quality bilingual marketing website for a recruiting product called "Plato".
The site’s goal is:
1) Convert EMPLOYERS to subscribe/book a demo (primary).
2) Send JOB SEEKERS to sign up and upload their resume (secondary).
We already have a job seeker portal at: https://applicant.platohiring.com
We may have an employer portal currently on the root domain (sometimes 502). Build the marketing site in a way that can work whether the employer portal remains on the root or moves to a subdomain later.

TECH + CONSTRAINTS
- Framework: Next.js (App Router)
- Styling: TailwindCSS
- Static hosting compatibility: MUST support static export for AWS S3 + CloudFront.
  - Avoid server-only dependencies.
  - Do not require a database for the website to render.
- Internationalization:
  - English: default at "/"
  - Arabic: at "/ar"
  - Language switcher button in header: "EN / AR"
  - Arabic pages must be full RTL layout (dir="rtl"), but logo/brand must not be mirrored.
- Design: Match a clean modern startup look, blue-based palette:
  - Primary blue: #057ABE
  - Secondary blue: #689AB9
  - Light background blue: #E0EEF3
  - Neutral gray: #AEB9C1
  - White background: #FFFFFF
  - Rounded cards, lots of whitespace, subtle shadows, smooth hover states.

DOMAIN / ROUTING ASSUMPTIONS (CONFIGURABLE)
- Marketing site: platohiring.com (public)
- Job seeker app: applicant.platohiring.com (existing)
- Employer app: unknown/stable later. Create configurable env var:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_EMPLOYER_APP_URL (default: "https://platohiring.com" for now)
- Job seeker app url env var:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_APPLICANT_APP_URL default: "https://applicant.platohiring.com"
- Demo booking link (Google Calendar) env var:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_BOOKING_URL default: "" (empty)
- Fallback email (until booking link exists) env var:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_EMAIL_FALLBACK default: "hello@platohiring.com"

PRIMARY CTAs (CONSISTENT ACROSS SITE)
- Employers: "Hire Talent" (goes to employer flow) + "Book a Demo"
- Job seekers: "Find Jobs" + "Upload Resume" (goes to applicant portal)
- Add a header "Login" button that goes to a chooser page.

SITE STRUCTURE (PAGES) — MUST IMPLEMENT
1) Home: "/" and "/ar"
2) For Employers: "/employers" and "/ar/employers"
3) For Job Seekers: "/job-seekers" and "/ar/job-seekers"
4) How it Works: "/how-it-works" and "/ar/how-it-works"
5) Blog index: "/blog" and "/ar/blog"
6) Blog post page: "/blog/[slug]" and "/ar/blog/[slug]"
   - Blog content stored as Markdown files in repo (no CMS). Use frontmatter for title/date/summary/tags/language.
7) FAQ: "/faq" and "/ar/faq"
8) Contact: "/contact" and "/ar/contact"
   - Contact form fields for employers:
     - Full name
     - Work email
     - Company
     - Role/Title
     - Hiring volume (dropdown: 1-5 / 6-20 / 21-50 / 50+)
     - Message
   - Store submissions to Supabase (client-side insert with RLS-safe anon insert).
   - Must work even if Supabase env vars missing: show a friendly message and fall back to mailto.
9) Security & Privacy: "/security" and "/ar/security"
   - General statements only; do NOT claim certifications (SOC2/ISO) because we don’t have them.
10) Legal:
   - Privacy Policy: "/privacy" and "/ar/privacy"
   - Terms of Service: "/terms" and "/ar/terms"
   - Use simple, non-fake, non-claimy placeholder legal text and clearly label it as "Template — replace before launch".
11) Pricing placeholder:
   - "/pricing" and "/ar/pricing" with "Coming Soon" but still strong CTA to Book a Demo.
12) Login chooser:
   - "/login" and "/ar/login"
   - Two big buttons:
     - "Employer Login" -> NEXT_PUBLIC_EMPLOYER_APP_URL (or /employers if unavailable)
     - "Job Seeker Login" -> NEXT_PUBLIC_APPLICANT_APP_URL

NAVIGATION (BEST PRACTICE)
Header nav items (in this order):
- For Employers
- For Job Seekers
- How it Works
- Blog
- FAQ
- Contact
Right side:
- Login
- Language switcher (EN/AR)
- Primary CTA button: "Book a Demo"
In Arabic, mirror navigation order visually (RTL) but keep brand/logo normal.

FOOTER (BEST PRACTICE)
Include:
- © Plato {current year}
- Links: Privacy, Terms, Security & Privacy, Contact
- Optional social placeholders: LinkedIn (no URL needed; allow config constants later)
- Language switcher not required in footer (header only is fine)

HOME PAGE CONTENT (EN) — WRITE REAL COPY, NOT LOREM IPSUM
Hero:
- Headline (lead with speed): "Hire faster with end-to-end screening and interview automation."
- Subheadline: "Plato turns resumes into a shortlist you can trust — with outreach, interviews, and structured reports built in."
Buttons:
- Primary: Hire Talent (employer flow)
- Secondary: Find Jobs (job seeker portal)
- Tertiary link: Upload Resume (job seeker portal)

Below hero: Trusted by section
- Show a row/grid of company logos (placeholders).
- Make the component accept local image files later: /public/logos/*.svg|png
- For now: use clean placeholder logo blocks with company name text.

Section: “For Employers” (summary)
- 3 benefit cards (NO unverifiable stats):
  1) Faster shortlisting: "Go from resumes to a ranked shortlist in hours, not weeks."
  2) Less HR effort: "Automate the busywork: screening, outreach, reminders, and interview scheduling."
  3) Better matches: "Structured evaluation and explainable fit signals — not guesswork."
CTA: "Book a Demo" + "Hire Talent"

Section: “For Job Seekers” (summary)
- 3 cards:
  1) "Upload once, apply smarter"
  2) "Get matched to roles that fit"
  3) "Stand out with structured interviews"
CTA: "Upload Resume" (to applicant portal) + "Find Jobs"

Section: How it Works (visual pipeline)
Employer flow (must match this exact wording order):
- Resume screening
- Shortlist top candidates
- Email / call outreach
- Automated interview
- Generate a structured report
Job seeker flow:
- Upload resume
- Create profile
- Get matched
- Interview
- Get shortlisted
Use a stepper/timeline UI with icons.

Section: Security & Privacy (high trust, general)
- Bullet points:
  - "We minimize data collection to what’s needed to deliver the service."
  - "Access controls and least-privilege practices."
  - "Encryption in transit (HTTPS)."
  - "You can request data deletion."
CTA: "Read Security & Privacy"

Section: Final CTA band
- Employers: "Ready to hire faster?" -> Book a Demo
- Job seekers: "Ready to upload your resume?" -> Upload Resume

ARABIC COPY REQUIREMENTS (FUSHA)
Provide Arabic equivalents for all headings/subheadlines/body copy.

- In code: if Supabase env vars missing:
  - Disable submit
  - Show "Form not configured yet — email us at hello@platohiring.com"

OR an equivalent clean approach that produces / and /ar.
- Put shared components in /components
- Put translations/copy in /lib/i18n or /messages
- Put constants in /lib/config.ts with env var fallbacks
- Put blog loader utilities in /lib/blog

DEPLOYMENT README (AWS S3 + CLOUDFRONT)
Create a README that explains:
- local dev: npm install, npm run dev
- static build/export: npm run build && npm run export (or Next.js export-compatible command)
- upload out/ to S3
- set CloudFront behavior
- cache invalidation tips
Also include notes about adding real logos and replacing legal template text.

QUALITY BAR
- No placeholder lorem ipsum except where explicitly labeled as template (legal).

- Provide a polished UI that matches the provided blue theme.

DELIVERABLE
- A complete working Next.js project with all routes, bilingual content, RTL support, blog system, contact form (optional Supabase), SEO assets, and AWS static-export instructions.
