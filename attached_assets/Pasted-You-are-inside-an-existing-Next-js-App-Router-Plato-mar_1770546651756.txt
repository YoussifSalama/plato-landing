PROBLEM
Top header buttons behave like tabs: clicking them hides the rest of the homepage and only shows the selected section. This is caused by state-based conditional rendering (activeTab/selectedSection). This must be removed.

GOAL
- The homepage must NEVER hide other sections.
- Header buttons should smooth-scroll to homepage sections using URL hashes (/#employers, /#job-seekers, etc.).
- Keep separate full pages as real routes for SEO (/employers, /job-seekers, /how-it-works, /security, etc.).
- Add smooth transitions:
  1) smooth scroll for section navigation
  2) subtle fade-in on page navigation

TASK 1 — REMOVE TAB LOGIC COMPLETELY
- Search the codebase for:
  - activeTab, selectedTab, activeSection, setActiveTab, setSelectedSection, tab, sectionState, etc.
- Remove ALL logic that conditionally renders only one section of the homepage.
- The Home page must render ALL sections in order:
  Hero -> Trusted By -> Employers -> Job Seekers -> How it Works -> Security & Privacy -> Final CTA -> Footer

TASK 2 — SECTION ANCHORS + SMOOTH SCROLL
- Add ids to the homepage sections:
  - Employers section: id="employers"
  - Job seekers section: id="job-seekers"
  - How it works section: id="how-it-works"
  - Security section: id="security"
- Update header links so these items link to hashes:
  - For Employers -> "/#employers"
  - For Job Seekers -> "/#job-seekers"
  - How it Works -> "/#how-it-works"
  - (Optional) Security -> "/#security"
- Blog, FAQ, Contact should remain real routes: /blog, /faq, /contact

TASK 3 — MAKE HASH LINKS WORK EVEN WHEN YOU’RE NOT ON HOME
- Create a small client component <SmartHashLink href="/#employers"> that:
  - If user is already on "/" (or "/ar"), it calls scrollIntoView({behavior:"smooth"}) and updates the URL hash.
  - If user is on another page, it navigates to "/" (or "/ar") with the hash, and on mount it auto-scrolls to that section smoothly.
- Also support Arabic home: "/ar#employers" (Arabic page should have the same ids on /ar)

TASK 4 — FIX STICKY HEADER OFFSET
- If you have a sticky header, add scroll margin so sections don’t hide under it:
  - In globals.css:
    html { scroll-behavior: smooth; }
    @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { html { scroll-behavior: auto; } }
    section[id] { scroll-margin-top: 96px; }  // adjust to header height

TASK 5 — SMOOTH PAGE TRANSITION (SUBTLE FADE)
- Add a lightweight fade-in transition on route changes:
  - Create a client wrapper component PageTransition that uses usePathname() and wraps children in a div with a CSS animation.
  - Key the wrapper by pathname so it re-mounts on navigation.
  - Add CSS:
    @keyframes pageFade { from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(4px);} to {opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0);} }
    .page-fade { animation: pageFade 220ms ease-out; }
    @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { .page-fade { animation: none; } }
- Apply PageTransition in the main layout around the page content.

TASK 6 — CLEAN HANDOFF FOR DEVELOPERS
- Add/Update:
  - README.md with: route map, i18n strategy, how section anchors work, env vars, blog adding instructions, build/export steps.
  - .env.example
  - docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (folder structure + routing + components)
  - docs/DATABASE.md (Supabase contact schema + RLS notes) if you already have the contact form.

ACCEPTANCE TEST
- Clicking header nav DOES NOT remove any sections.
- Header nav smoothly scrolls to the section.
- URL updates with hash (#employers).
- Back button works.
- Switching pages has a subtle fade-in.
- Respects prefers-reduced-motion.
