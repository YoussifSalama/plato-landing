You are working inside an existing Next.js (App Router) marketing website project for "Plato".
The current issue: clicking top navigation items causes the homepage to “switch” and hide everything except the clicked section (tab-like behavior). This is not desired.

GOAL
Refactor the site so navigation uses real routes (pages) and/or anchor scrolling, without hiding the rest of the homepage. The site must feel production-ready, bilingual (EN + AR), with Arabic full RTL (logo not mirrored), and the codebase must be developer-handoff friendly (README, docs, clear routes, DB schema docs).

REFACTOR NAV (MOST IMPORTANT)
1) Remove any “activeSection / selectedSection / tab state” logic that conditionally renders only one section.
2) Implement real routes as pages:
   - / (Home)
   - /employers
   - /job-seekers
   - /how-it-works
   - /blog
   - /faq
   - /contact
   - /security
   - /pricing (Coming Soon)
   Arabic versions:
   - /ar (Home)
   - /ar/employers
   - /ar/job-seekers
   - /ar/how-it-works
   - /ar/blog
   - /ar/faq
   - /ar/contact
   - /ar/security
   - /ar/pricing
3) Home page MUST keep all sections visible (Hero + Trusted By + Employers + Job Seekers + How it Works + Security + Final CTA + Footer).
4) Header navigation links must use Next.js <Link> and change URL properly.
5) Add active link styling in the header based on current pathname.

LANGUAGE SWITCHER (EN/AR)
- Keep a header button switcher labeled “EN / AR”.
- When switching languages, preserve the same page:
  - /employers -> /ar/employers
  - /ar/contact -> /contact
- Arabic pages must use dir="rtl" and proper alignment.
- Logo and brand remain LTR (not mirrored).

UI POLISH
- Keep the current clean modern style and blue theme.
- Make the header sticky with subtle border/shadow.
- Add a responsive mobile nav (hamburger) that includes all nav items and CTAs.
- Ensure buttons look consistent:
  - Primary: blue background (Book a Demo, Hire Talent, Upload Resume)
  - Secondary: outlined (Find Jobs)
- Add focus states and accessibility (keyboard nav, aria labels).

CONFIGURATION (ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
Create /lib/config.ts that reads env vars with defaults:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_EMPLOYER_APP_URL (default: https://platohiring.com)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APPLICANT_APP_URL (default: https://applicant.platohiring.com)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_BOOKING_URL (default: "")
- NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_EMAIL_FALLBACK (default: hello@platohiring.com)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_LINKEDIN_URL (default: "")

Buttons behavior:
- "Hire Talent" -> EMPLOYER_APP_URL
- "Find Jobs" + "Upload Resume" -> APPLICANT_APP_URL (direct to signup/upload path if exists, else root)
- "Book a Demo":
  - If DEMO_BOOKING_URL exists: open it
  - Else: mailto DEMO_EMAIL_FALLBACK with subject "Plato Demo Request"

BLOG
- Keep blog as markdown-based.
- Ensure /blog and /ar/blog work.
- Add search + tag filter on blog index.
- Add a clean post template.

CONTACT FORM (SUPABASE OPTIONAL)
- Use env vars:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- If set, submit form to Supabase table contact_leads.
- If missing, disable submit and show fallback mailto CTA.

DOCUMENTATION (MAKE HANDOFF EASY)
Add these files:
1) README.md
   - Project overview
   - Tech stack
   - How to run locally
   - Route map (list every route)
   - Env vars (with .env.example)
   - How to add blog posts
   - How to replace placeholder logos with real ones
   - How to build for static hosting (AWS S3 + CloudFront)
2) docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Folder structure explanation
   - i18n/RTL strategy
   - Where config lives
3) docs/DATABASE.md
   - Supabase schema SQL for contact_leads
   - RLS policy example that allows anonymous inserts only
   - How to test inserts
4) .env.example

DATABASE SCHEMA (PUT IN docs/DATABASE.md)
Provide SQL like:
- contact_leads:
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid()
  created_at timestamptz default now()
  name text
  email text
  company text
  role text
  hiring_volume text
  message text
  source_page text
  language text

Add RLS notes. Do NOT claim certifications on Security page.

SEO
- Add per-page meta title/description in EN/AR.
- Add sitemap.xml and robots.txt generation compatible with static export.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Clicking top nav DOES NOT hide other homepage sections.
- Pages are accessible via URL and back button works.
- EN/AR switch preserves the same page.
- Codebase has README + docs + .env.example and is easy for a developer to understand.
